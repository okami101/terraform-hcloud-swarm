# Terraform Hetzner Cloud Swarm

## üéØ About

Get a cheap Swarm cluster in less than **5 minutes**, with optional HA support, with easy configuration setup through simple Terraform variables, üíØ GitOps compatible !

This opinionated Terraform template will generate a ready-to-go cloud infrastructure through Hetzner Cloud provider, with a ready-to-go initialized Docker Swarm cluster, the most lightweight container's orchestrator.

Additional managers and workers can be easily added thanks to terraform variables, even after initial setup for **easy upscaling**. Feel free to fork this project in order to adapt for your custom needs.

Check [K3S provider](https://github.com/okami101/terraform-hcloud-k3s) for a full-featured, but more resource consuming, orchestrator based on Kubernetes distribution.

### Networking and firewall

All nodes including LB will be linked with a proper private network as well as **solid firewall protection**. For admin management, only the 1st main manager (bastion) node will have open port only for SSH (configurable), with **IP whitelist** support. Other internal nodes will be accessed by SSH Jump.

Hetzner Load Balancer (optional) can be used for any external public access to your cluster. You have 2 options for LB :

* Put it front of **managers**, so you need at least 3 managers for HA support (odd number mandatory for quorum)
* Put it front of **workers**, so you need at least 2 workers for HA support. In this case, 1 single manager is required which is the far HA cheaper option.

Note that if you use the worker option, and if you use Traefik as proxy for route detection, you **MUST** configure it for using the **manager docker API endpoint**, otherwise it will not be able to detect newly added services. You can use **Socat** as simple socket proxy for this purpose.

### OS management

This Terraform template includes **[Salt Project](https://docs.saltproject.io)** as well for easy global OS management of the cluster through ssh, perfect for upgrades in one single time !

## ‚úÖ Requirements

Before starting, you need to have :

1. A Hetzner cloud account.
2. A `terraform` client.
3. A `hcloud` client.
4. A `docker` client.

On Windows :

```powershell
scoop install terraform hcloud
```

## üèÅ Starting

### Prepare

The first thing to do is to prepare a new hcloud project :

1. Create a new **EMPTY** hcloud empty project.
2. Generate a **Read/Write API token key** to this new project according to [this official doc](https://docs.hetzner.com/cloud/api/getting-started/generating-api-token/).

### Setup

Now it's time for initial cluster setup.

1. Copy [this swarm config example](swarm.tf.example) into a new empty directory and rename it `swarm.tf`.
2. Execute `terraform init` in order to install the required module
3. Replace all variables according your own needs.
4. Finally, use `terraform apply` to check the plan and initiate the cluster setup.

## Usage

### Access

Once terraform installation is complete, terraform will output the SSH config necessary to connect to your cluster for each node as well as following public IPs :

| Variable     | Description                                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `bastion_ip` | Bastion IP for OS and Docker swarm management          |
| `lb_ip`      | Load Balancer IP to use for any external public access |
| `lb_id`      | Load Balancer ID to use for attaching any services     |

Copy the SSH config to your own SSH config, default to `~/.ssh/config`. After few minutes, you can use `ssh <cluster_name>` in order to log in to your main manager node. For other nodes, the first manager node will be used as a bastion for direct access to other nodes, so use `ssh <cluster_name>-worker-01` to directly access to your *worker-01* node.

### Salt

Once logged to your bastion, don't forget to active *Salt*, just type `sudo salt-key -A` in order to accept all discovered minions. You are now ready to use any `salt` commands for global OS management, as `sudo salt '*' pkg.upgrade` for global OS upgrade in one single time.

> If salt-key command is not existing, wait few minutes as it's necessary that cloud-init has finished his job.

### Docker Swarm

#### Join nodes

By default, and because there is sadly no possibility to set a custom token for swarm, you must join all managers and workers node in order to have fully ready cluster. When logged to bastion, use :

* `docker swarm join-token worker` to print command to launch in every worker nodes.
* `docker swarm join-token manager` to print command to launch in every manager nodes.

Use `docker node ls` to check that all nodes are correctly joined to the cluster.

Finally, for remote usage from docker CLI through a secured SSH tunnel, you can use following command from your local machine :

```sh
# create a new docker context
docker context create --docker host=ssh://<cluster_name> --description="My Swarm cluster" my-swarm-cluster

# use it
docker context use my-swarm-cluster

# check it
docker info
docker node ls
```

#### Upscaling and downscaling

You can easily add or remove nodes by changing the `count` variable of each worker or manager. Then use `terraform apply` to apply the changes.

* When adding, the new manager or worker node will be automatically created, but you still need to join it to the cluster by using above related command. Don't also forget to accept the new minion with `sudo salt-key -A`.

## Topologies

Contrary to Kubernetes which is really suited for a specific kind of topology (HA in front of workers), Docker is highly flexible and give you many ways to build your cluster for any needs. Here are some examples of topologies you can use with this Terraform template.

> I'm using here Traefik (not included) which is the perfect reverse proxy for route detection through Docker API.

### Docker compose

```tf
# ...
managers_count = 1
workers_count  = 0
# ...
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
client((Client))
client -- Port 80 + 443 --> traefik-01
subgraph manager-01
  traefik-01{Traefik SSL}
  app-01([My App replica 1])
  app-02([My App replica 2])
  traefik-01 --> app-01
  traefik-01 --> app-02
end
DB[(My App DB)]
app-01 --> DB
app-02 --> DB
```

Pros :

* The cheapest and dead simplest solution
* Blue green deployment always possible thanks to Docker and Traefik combination
* No swarm needed, use directly docker-compose

Cons :

* No HA, mandatory downtime for maintenance
* No horizontal scalability, only vertical
* All resources constrained to 1 single node, high SRP violation
* Need SSL management for Traefik
* Server exposed to public internet

### 1 manager + X workers

```tf
# ...
managers_count = 1
workers_count  = 2
# ...
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
client((Client))
client -- Port 80 + 443 --> traefik-01
subgraph manager-01
  traefik-01{Traefik SSL}
end
subgraph worker-01
  app-01([My App replica 1])
  traefik-01 --> app-01
end
subgraph worker-02
  app-02([My App replica 2])
  traefik-01 --> app-02
end
DB[(My App DB)]
app-01 --> DB
app-02 --> DB
```

Pros :

* A balanced cheap while performant option
* Horizontal scalability excluding Traefik
* Workload mostly separated from manager, securing the cluster from congestion

Cons :

* No HA, mandatory downtime for manager maintenance
* Need SSL management for Traefik
* When high load, Traefik can be a bottleneck
* Cluster exposed to public internet

### X managers

```tf
# ...
managers_count = 3
workers_count  = 0
lb_target = "manager"
# ...
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
client((Client))
client -- Port 80 + 443 --> lb{LB}
lb{LB}
subgraph manager-01
  traefik-01{Traefik}
  app-01([My App replica 1])
  traefik-01 --> app-01
end
subgraph manager-02
  traefik-02{Traefik}
  app-02([My App replica 2])
  traefik-02 --> app-02
end
subgraph manager-03
  traefik-03{Traefik}
  app-03([My App replica 3])
  traefik-03 --> app-03
end
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-01
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-02
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-03
DB[(My App DB)]
app-01 --> DB
app-02 --> DB
app-03 --> DB
```

Pros :

* The cheapest HA solution
* Load Balancer takes care of SSL
* Zero downtime achievable

Cons :

* Need at least 3 managers or any superior odd number (7 max) in order to maintain quorum
* Limited horizontal scalability
* Risk of unresponsive swarm cluster if high load

### 1 manager + X workers + LB

```tf
# ...
managers_count = 1
workers_count  = 2
lb_target = "worker"
# ...
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
client((Client))
client -- Port 80 + 443 --> lb{LB}
lb{LB}
subgraph manager-01
  overlay[Docker API + overlay network]
end
subgraph worker-01
  traefik-01{Traefik}
  app-01([My App replica 1])
end
subgraph worker-02
  traefik-02{Traefik}
  app-02([My App replica 2])
end
traefik-01 --> overlay
traefik-02 --> overlay
overlay --> app-01
overlay --> app-02
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-01
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-02
DB[(My App DB)]
app-01 --> DB
app-02 --> DB
```

Pros :

* Load Balancer takes care of SSL
* Zero downtime achievable
* Horizontal scalability
* Free to add workers easily
* Workload clearly separated from manager, securing the cluster
* The topology used in Kubernetes world

Cons :

* A little more expensive
* No HA for manager
* In order to work, Traefik must be configured for using manager docker API endpoint, otherwise it will not be able to detect newly added services. You can use Socat as simple socket proxy for this purpose.
* If more than 1 manager, you way prefer next topology, which moves Traefik to managers.

### X managers + Y workers + LB

```tf
# ...
managers_count = 3
workers_count  = 3
lb_target = "manager"
# ...
```

```mermaid
flowchart TD
client((Client))
client -- Port 80 + 443 --> lb{LB}
lb{LB}
subgraph manager-01
  traefik-01{Traefik}
end
subgraph manager-02
  traefik-02{Traefik}
end
subgraph manager-03
  traefik-03{Traefik}
end
subgraph worker-01
  app-01([My App replica 1])
end
subgraph worker-02
  app-02([My App replica 2])
end
subgraph worker-03
  app-03([My App replica 3])
end
overlay(Docker overlay network)
traefik-01 --> overlay
traefik-02 --> overlay
traefik-03 --> overlay
overlay --> app-01
overlay --> app-02
overlay --> app-03
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-01
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-02
lb -- Port 80 --> traefik-03
DB[(My App DB)]
app-01 --> DB
app-02 --> DB
app-03 --> DB
```

Pros :

* The most robust HA solution for managers and workers
* Free to add managers and workers easily
* Full horizontal scalability for managers and workers

Cons :

* The most expensive solution
